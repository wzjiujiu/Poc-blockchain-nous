# Smart contracts documentation

This document contains the generated documentation of the main smart contracts.

This documentation was extracted from the SolidityDoc present in the methods and events.

## UpgradeControl

Upgrade control This smart contract manges the upgrades of other contracts

### Events

**ContractUpgraded(address,address,address)**
 - Description: ContractUpgraded - A smart contract was upgraded
 - Parameters:
    - `by` - The address of the administrator who made the upgrade
    - `implementation` - The address of the implementation contract
    - `proxy` - The address of the proxy contract

**Initialized(uint64)**
 - Details: Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.

**Paused(address)**
 - Description: Paused - The smart contract was paused
 - Parameters:
    - `by` - The administrator who paused the smart contract

**Unpaused(address)**
 - Description: Paused - The smart contract was paused
 - Parameters:
    - `by` - The administrator who paused the smart contract

**Upgraded(address)**
 - Details: Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.


### Methods

**getInitializedVersion()**
 - Description: Gets the current initialized version Use this method to figure out the last deployed version of the contract
 - Returns:
    - `v` - The current initialized version

**initialize(address)**
 - Description: Initializes the smart contract
 - Parameters:
    - `roleManagerAddress` - The address of the role manager smart contract

**pause()**
 - Description: Pauses the smart contract Requires ADMIN role

**paused()**
 - Description: Checks if the smart contract is paused
 - Returns:
    - `_0` - bool True if paused, false otherwise

**proxiableUUID()**
 - Details: Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.

**unpause()**
 - Description: Unpauses the smart contract Requires ADMIN role

**upgradeContract(address,address)**
 - Description: Upgrades a smart contract Requires ADMIN role
 - Parameters:
    - `implementation` - The address of the implementation contract
    - `proxy` - The address of the proxy contract

**upgradeContractAndCall(address,address,bytes)**
 - Description: Upgrades a smart contract and calls a re-initializer Requires ADMIN role
 - Parameters:
    - `callData` - The callData of the re-initializer
    - `implementation` - The address of the implementation contract
    - `proxy` - The address of the proxy contract

**upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)**
 - Details: Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.


## RoleManager

RoleManager - Smart contract to manage the roles of the participants

 - Parameters:
    - `account` - The account
    - `by` - The address of the administrator who revoked the role
    - `role` - The role

**Unpaused(address)**
 - Description: Paused - The smart contract was paused
 - Parameters:
    - `by` - The administrator who paused the smart contract

**Upgraded(address)**
 - Details: Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.


### Methods

 - Parameters:
    - `account` - The account address
    - `role` - The role to assign
 - Returns:

**proxiableUUID()**
 - Details: Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.

**upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)**
 - Details: Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.
